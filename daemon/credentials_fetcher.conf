#Default mode is "ecs" as in AWS ECS, which is also requires
#the instance to be domain - joined to Active Directory.

#In "ecs" mode, the AWS ECS agent provides configuration for credentials_fetcher

#In "eks" mode, initial configuration will be read from / etc / credentials_fetcher_kubeconfig.json
#This does not prevent further grpc configuration

#Specifies alternate krbdir path, the default is / var / credentials - fetcher / krbdir
#credentials_fetcher_krbdir_path = "/var/credentials-fetcher/krbdir"

#If you need to have a krb file with a suffix such as _1000 so that
#the kerberos ticket file looks like krb5cc_1000, you can uncomment and use this option
#credentials_fetcher_krbfile_suffix = _1000

#If grpc is used, leases are created under / var / credentials - fetcher / krbdir / < uuid>
#This option makes the directory fixed for config file use - case
#As an example,                                                                                    \
